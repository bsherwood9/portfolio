# portfolio

There are a number of things that I want to do to change my portfolio.

1. Set everything up in React
2. Add a custom logo that I build
3. Use atleast 1 custom hook
4. Style with material-UI

I'd like to get a lot of this done by February 2 2020

How am I going to use state here?
Should I create a database or json file of all my projects, or just hard code them in?
What is the overall aesthetic that I want to convey that describes me?
Good example is kent c dodds website.

Greensock maybe for the animations??
