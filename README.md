# portfolio

There are a number of things that I want to do to change my portfolio.

1. Set everything up in React
2. Add a custom logo that I build
3. Use atleast 1 custom hook
4. Style with material-UI

#100DaysOfCode

How am I going to use state here?
Should I create a database or json file of all my projects, or just hard code them in?
What is the overall aesthetic that I want to convey that describes me?
Good example is kent c dodds website.
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/
https://robbowen.digital/

Greensock maybe for the animations??
Going to be using ADOBE XD to really build this out. Already added a react app that I will eventually replace this app with.

Now need to add designs, start building, and figure out if these changes will break the live site that I am hosting.

Figured I may need to delay this project as I am still trying to get redux to work .

Which projects to add to portfolio?
